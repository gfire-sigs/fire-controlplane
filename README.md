# GFire Control Plane

This project is the control plane for the gfire system. It centralizes and manages
various aspects of system operations, configurations, and state management through a distributed finite state machine architecture.

## Overview

The control plane (`pkg.gfire.dev/controlplane`) is responsible for:
- Distributed state management using a finite state machine (FSM) architecture
- Consensus-based coordination across multiple nodes
- System monitoring and automated adjustments
- Managing internal services and communications

## Core Components

### Finite State Machine (FSM)

The FSM package provides a robust state management system supporting:
- State transitions with update types for different system aspects (network, config, metrics, etc.)
- State snapshots and restoration capabilities
- Temporal context tracking for state transitions

### Consensus System

The consensus package implements distributed coordination featuring:
- Fault-tolerant consensus protocol for distributed decision making
- State replication across multiple nodes
- Leader election mechanisms
- Failure detection and handling

## Requirements

- Go 1.24.1 or later
