# Consensus Package

## Overview

The consensus package implements distributed consensus algorithms used within the gFire control plane system. This module is responsible for ensuring that distributed nodes can reach agreement on system state, even in the presence of failures.

## Components

- **Consensus Protocol**: Implementation of a fault-tolerant consensus mechanism
- **State Replication**: Ensures consistent state across multiple nodes
- **Leader Election**: Algorithms for selecting coordinator nodes
- **Failure Detection**: Mechanisms to identify and handle node failures

## Integration with FSM

This package works closely with the [`fsm`](../fsm/README.md) package to ensure that state transitions are consistently applied across all nodes in the distributed system. The consensus algorithm guarantees that:

1. All healthy nodes agree on the same sequence of state transitions
2. System makes progress even if some nodes fail (within tolerance limits)
3. No conflicting decisions are made
