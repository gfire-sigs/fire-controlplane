## Finite State Machine (FSM) Architecture

This project uses an FSM architecture to manage state transitions in a predictable and maintainable manner.

### Overview
- **States:** Represent discrete statuses of the system.
- **Transitions:** Define permissible movements between states.
- **Events:** Trigger state changes.
- **FSM Implementation:** A modular, Go-based implementation is provided to encapsulate FSM behavior.

### How to Use
1. Define your states and events.
2. Implement transitions according to business logic.
3. Use the FSM module to process events and update states accordingly.

### Boilerplate
This README serves as a starting point. Additional documentation and examples will be added over time.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you handle error conditions gracefully.
- Use logging for state changes and errors for easier debugging.
