# The FSM Package

The FSM (Finite State Machine) package provides an implementation of a state machine for managing complex workflows and state transitions in a controlled manner.

## Overview

This package implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) that:
- Defines discrete states
- Controls transitions between states
- Executes actions on state transitions
- Validates state transition rules

## Features

- **State Management**: Define and track system states
- **Controlled Transitions**: Allow only valid state changes
- **Event Handling**: Process events that trigger state transitions
- **Action Execution**: Run specific actions when entering or leaving states
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manage invalid state transitions

## Usage

To use the FSM package, define your states and transition rules, then initialize the state machine with an initial state. The FSM will enforce your transition rules and execute the appropriate actions when state changes occur.

## Implementation

The package is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate into existing applications. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous state transitions and provides hooks for logging and monitoring.
